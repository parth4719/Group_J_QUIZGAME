# Group_J_QuizGame

This quiz game application is used to test the general knowledge of the player. This application will be importing the quiz data from an excel file. Once the quiz is launched, the user will have only 10 seconds to answer each question or else it will skip to the next question. The users will be prompted with their respective scores and the total points earned at the end of the quiz with the highest score of the quiz. The user can reset the Highest score of the quiz on his/ her device to start again from scratch or even request for help to know additional information about the quiz in the main menu of the quiz.
